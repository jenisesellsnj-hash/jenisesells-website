# Real Estate Star

A SaaS platform that automates real estate agent workflows — from lead response and market analysis to contract drafting and website deployment.

## Why

Small independent agents spend hours on repetitive tasks: responding to leads, pulling comps, drafting contracts, updating their website. Real Estate Star automates all of it with AI-powered skills that read from a simple JSON config per agent.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edward-rosado/Real-Estate-Star.git
cd Real-Estate-Star

# macOS / Linux / Git Bash
bash setup.sh

# Windows PowerShell
.\setup.ps1
```

## Multi-Tenant Architecture

Every agent (tenant) has a JSON config file at `config/agents/{agent-id}.json`. All skills read from this config — no hardcoded agent data anywhere.

```json
{
  "id": "jenise-buckalew",
  "identity": { "name": "Jenise Buckalew", "email": "...", "phone": "..." },
  "location": { "state": "NJ", "service_areas": ["Middlesex County", "..."] },
  "branding": { "primary_color": "#1B5E20", "accent_color": "#C8A951" },
  "integrations": { "email_provider": "gmail", "form_handler": "formspree" },
  "compliance": { "state_form": "NJ-REALTORS-118" }
}
```

Adding a new agent = creating a new JSON file. No code changes needed.

## Adding a New State

Contracts are state-agnostic. To add support for a new state:

1. Create `skills/contracts/templates/{STATE}/README.md`
2. Document the state's standard form, sections, and fields
3. Add entry to the supported states table in `skills/contracts/SKILL.md`
